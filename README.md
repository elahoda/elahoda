### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Real Estate to Web Development. Prior IT roles in Infrastructure, Security Engineering, and Pre-Sales, where I developed real-world engineering problem-solving skills ready to use with coding. 

Now I'm embracing both front-end and back-end development, and I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of technology through a continuous reinvention in my career journey.

I'm open to collaborating with any like-minded people on projects. 

Fun facts: I still have my VIC-20, am a licensed Realtor in PA and NJ, and love to ski.
