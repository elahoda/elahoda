### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My focus is Web coding from Front-end to Back-end development.
My Bachelor's degree was in Electrical Engineering and my technology work experience includes IT Infrastructure and IT Security, and my recent business experience includes Real Estate and IT sales. To update my technical skills, I have become a self-taught coder, with the help of online bootcamps, Nucamp and Skillcrush covering front-end and back-end development.
- HTML/CSS with Bootstrap
- Web Development with React using React Hooks and state-aware applications using Redux
- Mobile Development with React Native
- Server Side deployment using Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB
- Database and Storage using MongoDB
- WordPress & PHP

I'm open to collaborating with any like-minded people on projects. 

Fun facts: I still have my VIC-20, licensed Realtor in PA and NJ, and love to ski.
