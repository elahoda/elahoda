### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Self-reinvention from a Real Estate Agent to a full-stack Web Developer. Previously, I was an IT Infrastructure, IT Security Engineer, and IT Sales Engineer, solving technical challenges. Now I want to do the same with code. Formerly, I had a bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering and now I am becoming a self-taught coder with the help of online boot camps, such as Nucamp and Skillcrush covering front-end and back-end development.
- HTML/CSS with Bootstrap
- Web Development with React using React Hooks and state-aware applications using Redux
- Mobile Development with React Native
- Server Side deployment using Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB
- Database and Storage using MongoDB
- WordPress & PHP

I'm open to collaborating with any like-minded people on projects. 

Fun facts: I still have my VIC-20, licensed Realtor in PA and NJ, and love to ski.
