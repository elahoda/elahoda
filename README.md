### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Transitioning from real estate to web development, I bring IT expertise, eager to tackle coding challenges. My background includes roles in IT Infrastructure, IT Security Engineering, and IT Sales, where I developed real-world engineering problem-solving skills ready to use with coding. 

Now I'm embracing both front-end and back-end development, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving world of technology through continuous reinvention in my career journey.

I'm open to collaborating with any like-minded people on projects. 

Fun facts: I still have my VIC-20, licensed Realtor in PA and NJ, and love to ski.
